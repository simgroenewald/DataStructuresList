Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 21

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called 'listTypes.py'.
● Imagine you want to store the names of three of your friends in a list of
Strings. Create a list variable called friends_names, and write the syntax to
store the full names of three of your friends.
● Now, write statements to print out the name of the first friend, then the
name of the last friend, and finally the length of the list.
● Now, define a list called friends_ages, that stores the age of each of your
friends in a corresponding manner, i.e., the first entry of this list is the age
of the friend named first in your other list.

Compulsory Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called 'loop1000.py'.
● You are asked to print out all the numbers from 1 to 1000. Write 2 lines of
code in your file to print out all numbers from 1 to 1000.
● Once you've got this to work, add logic inside your loop to only print out
the numbers from 1 to 1000 that are even (i.e. divisible by 2). Remember
the modulo command - i.e., %. 10%5 will give you the remainder of 10
divided by 5. 10 divided by 5 equals 2 with a remainder of 0. Hence, this
statement returns 0. Any even number is a number that can be divided by
2 with no remainder.

Compulsory Task 3
Follow these steps:
● Write a Python program called “John.py” that takes in a user’s input as a
String.
● While the String is not “John”, add every String entered to a list until John”
is entered. Then print out the list. This program basically stores all
incorrectly entered Strings in a list where “John” is the only correct String.
● Example program run (what should show up in the Python Console when
you run it):
Enter your name : <user enters Tim>
Enter your name : <user enters Mark>
Enter your name: <user enters John>
Incorrect names: [‘Tim’, ‘Mark’]
